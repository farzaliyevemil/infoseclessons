# 🧩 What is WSL?

**WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is a feature in Windows that allows you to run a full Linux environment directly on your Windows machine — without using a virtual machine (VM) or dual booting.

Originally introduced in Windows 10, WSL has become essential for developers, cybersecurity professionals, and system administrators who need Linux tools on a Windows system.

# ❓ Why use WSL?

Here are the most common reasons:

- 🔧 Use **Linux tools (bash, apt, git, ssh)** directly on Windows.
- 💻 Avoid the hassle of dual-boot setups or resource-heavy virtual machines.
- 📂 Seamless file sharing between Windows and Linux environments.
- ⚡ Access to terminal-based pentest tools on Windows (e.g., Nmap, Nikto, etc.).

# 🛠️ How to Install WSL (Recommended: WSL2)

### 📌 Windows 10/11 Command (PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This will:

- Install the WSL core.
- Install Ubuntu as the default Linux distro.
- Enable WSL2 automatically (on Windows 11).

You may need to restart your system after installation.

# 🔐 WSL for Cybersecurity

WSL is extremely valuable for InfoSec tasks, such as:

- Running Linux-only pentesting tools.
- Practicing shell scripting.
- Interacting with networking tools (e.g., `nmap`, `netcat`).
- Analyzing log files and malware in a safe sandbox.

# 💡 Example: Installing and Using Nmap in WSL

To install and use Nmap in WSL, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap
nmap -sV localhost
```
