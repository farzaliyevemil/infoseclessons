## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Full Disk Encryption**: Encrypts all data on the disk.
- **Integration with TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: Uses TPM to securely store encryption keys.
- **Recovery Key for Restoration**: Allows recovery of encrypted disks using a Recovery Key.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- Simple management (via GUI and PowerShell).
- Full disk encryption.
- **BitLocker To Go**: Encryption support for USB devices.
